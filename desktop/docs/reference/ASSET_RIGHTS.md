# Asset Rights and Publication Classification

This record covers tracked visual assets that could enter a future public Phil
source snapshot. It records repository evidence, not trademark permission or a
legal conclusion.

## Rights-cleared third-party presentation assets

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/philcore-desktop/src/renderer/assets/pixelify-sans-latin-wght-normal.woff2` | Pixelify Sans Project Authors; `@fontsource-variable/pixelify-sans` npm package `5.3.0`, resolved by the PhilUI lockfile from `https://registry.npmjs.org/@fontsource-variable/pixelify-sans/-/pixelify-sans-5.3.0.tgz` | SIL OFL 1.1; copied unmodified; SHA-256 `4a5633a0c9c1b73abd133a56d3716c2d8df2ed03cb987346f72194aeb224f382` | Include with `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `LICENSES/OFL-1.1-Pixelify-Sans.txt`; the Desktop distributable must carry both notices. |

## Historical chain-mark renditions

Advertised public Git history contains three small SVG renditions introduced by
Phil commit `a9c7f758a235dfbd39075af90d5cbe9261793f0c`: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
Solana. The original successful local authoring record has now been recovered:
all three generated file contents match their introduction Git blobs byte for
byte. They were locally AI-generated Phil UI renditions of third-party marks;
this establishes their creation origin, not independent ownership of the marks.
See [the exact historical provenance record](./HISTORICAL_CHAIN_MARK_PROVENANCE.md).
Their current absence from the UI and distribution does not clear the
historical public-source scope.
**Creation provenance is resolved. Rights clearance remains unresolved pending
an applicable permission/use basis or a separately authorized disposition.**
This is a release blocker, not a finding of infringement. The Phil MIT license
does not grant third-party trademark rights. Current Phil branding is unchanged.

## Excluded artwork

The public candidate continues to exclude uncleared chain-logo renditions and
third-party-project preview artwork. The newly tracked 3D Phil and Avastar
character poses are a narrow exception backed by the owner's direct
authorization above. The previously used flat-character and riding-pair assets
are not runtime inputs. The Desktop catalog continues to use generic text/CSS
tiles, without replacement logos or implied third-party endorsement.

Future assets must record creator, source, governing license or permission,
required attribution, modification status, and whether the asset is software
documentation or separately controlled Phil branding.
